    <p>You sang a list of colors for TCI's first weekend event. Can you tell me more about your singing?
    </p>
    </div>
  <div class="p3">
    <p>It was during a workshop at Yale when I sang "Happy Birthday."" At the time, I was feeling sad because I was in a foreign country for the first time, and I felt awkward announcing my birthday to new people, so I kept it a secret and spent my birthday alone. It turned out I very much enjoyed it.
    </p>
    </div>
  <div class="p4">
    <p>Singing "Happy Birthday" was a way of celebrating my own time.

    <p>I also do this "alone birthday."
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p6">
    <p>Yeah, every birthday I can do something new. Like watching a new movie, going to a new place, simple things like that. I usually feel kind of awkward with a group of people.

  <p>Where are your favorite places to find solitude in New York?
  </p>
  </div>
<div class="p8">
  <p>I find most of my solitude in my own room. While at school, I had enormous time to watch films, sing, write, read, play the keyboard, etc. I call this my absorbing time. It's so important to me to have time and space to dive and be immersed.
    </p>
  </div>
<div class="p9">
  <p>I also enjoy being in a piano room (could be anywhere). I don't need to play any perfect melodies. Sometimes I just like playing some simple notes to clear my head.
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="p10">
  <p>When I return home from work late at 2 or 3am, usually no people are on the street. At this time of night, I feel very free somehow.
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="p11">
  <p>I listen to music <br>
and walk zigzag <br>
and sometimes dance along <br>the road. <br>
I look at the sky,<br>
the surroundings.</p>
</div>
<div class="p12">
  <p>It feels so good. No one can see me.</p>

<p>Why is being alone so important?</p>
</div>
<div class="p14">
  <p>When I'm alone, </p>
  </div>
<div class="p15">
  <p>I become more sensitive to my surroundings.<br>
I am more aware of my path, <br>
if I like the color of this building, <br>
or if I remember that dirty plastic bag floating <br>
under the sunshine and onto the mud. </p>
</div>
<div class="p16">
  <p>If I were with a group, I might not notice these things because you need to talk to people and follow the group. I like to have my own pace and rhythm and not worry about following or catching the group.
    </p>

  <div class="p17">
    <p>When I'm alone, I feel like a human camera.

<div class="p18">
  <p>You feel everything around you completely, and every pore of your body has a zoom-in function.
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="p19">
  <p>When I'm in my room, I try to be a sponge. I can absorb a ton and learn by myself. It's like having a journey. You are searching and collecting pieces that belong to you. There is a lot of joy in finding something that intrigues you.
  </p>
  </div>
<div class="p20">
  <p>I feel there is more "nutrition" in solitude, and I consider myself to be more productive alone. Solitude can be very philosophical because it's both very closed and very open. In being alone, people feel you are distant, that you don't like socializing that much, and that you live in a vacuum; but at the same time, you are so open to the world: you are
